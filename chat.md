## What the matrix?
Matrix is the future of online communication, in that respect kind of the successor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" class="extURL" target="_blank">IRC</a>:  
* open source protocol  
* open source client (from web to fancy mobile, see <a href="https://element.io" class="extURL" target="_blank">element.io</a>)  
* open source server  
* decentralized  
* end-to-end encryption  
* no need to register (guest access)  
* endless history (even for guests if so desired)  
* bridges with #irc #telegram #slack #gitter and more
