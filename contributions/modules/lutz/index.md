Hey Guys,

did you ever discussed with an art director about the choice of color, while having to fix heavy code issues.
Worry no more as evvvvil would say. Just make a snapshot of your patch - send it over. Let him do the color correction in Photoshop, lightroom or wherever. Load his file - and you are done.

We use a 5 bit encoding index to track all changes beeing made in photoshop and apply them to your real time rendering.

This is a lightweigth implementation of a very common technique from the video game industry. 

And this is how it works
