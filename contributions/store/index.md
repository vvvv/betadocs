Licensing per PC: €42 (to answer your needs)  

This node pack defines a new Message data link and c# type. Its primary purpose is to help you retain data and performance control if your vvvv project turns bigger than expected, without adding redundant and confusing links. Message can help to establish communication between threads or even other applications.

## DX11 Imagesequence Player
Author: [NSYNK Gesellschaft für Kunst und Technik mbH](https://vvvv.org/businesses/nsynk-gesellschaft-für-kunst-und-technik), arturo  
Licensing: 400€ per project per machine

Ultra-HighEnd video playback performance for vvvv / dx11. 

The player is designed to deliver the highest bandwidth of uncompressed and block-compressed image sequences. It copies image data directly to GPU memory and does all byteswizzling and padding in computeshaders, no CPU involved. The data rate is limited only by memory bandwidth and bus speed. With the right hardware more than 2x 4Kp60 of uncompressed video is possible, which means data rates of up to 5GB/sec.

Threads are completely decoupled, leaving the v4 mainloop untouched even of the heaviest data streams.

Supported Formats:
- TGA
- DPX up to 10bit per channel
- BC1, BC3, BC5, BC6, BC7

## Content Management System
Author: [u7angel](http://vvvv.org/users/u7angel) of [wirmachenbunt](https://vvvv.org/businesses/wirmachenbunt)  
License: €500 per machine (plus VAT)

Enter the exciting world of content management ;)
Seriously, if you have a large project, with lot's of information, texts and media, you might want to manage that in a less painful way than using folders and XML files. Maybe you even want the texts to be pre-rendered. And i guess you want a safe and simple interface for your customer to let them enter the information themselves.
Then you probably fancy a content management system like this. Get a coffee or two and check out the introduction video.
