# Staff Picks

One of the most valuable resource of vvvv is it's community. Over the years many users of vvvv have created amazing contributions and extensions.

On this page we have compiled a "Best Of" list of contributions everyone should be aware of when working on a project. They all will make your patching life easier and will save you from re-inventing the wheel.

If you have any additions or changes, please let us know in the forums.
