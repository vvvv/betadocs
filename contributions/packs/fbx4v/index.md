1.  FBX4V

is an advanced FBX importer using the official Autodesk FBX SDK 2018. It might be a better choice instead of the Assimp importer if you want to use a feature specific to FBX like:
* Embedded media
* Blendshapes
* Triangulating NURBS, or higher order faces than triangles
* Using multiple UV layers
* Handling node transformation hierarchy properly
* Instantly use rigged meshes (skeletal animation) coming right from the main SkeletalMesh node
* Having a more shader oriented pipeline

##  Installation:

If you haven't already, Get [vpm](xref:contribution/vpm)
###  <a href="vpms://raw.githubusercontent.com/vvvvpm/vpdb/master/microdee/FBX4V/17.08.15.vpack">Install via vpm</a>

Read the EULA and on the bottom you'll find a toggle button for assets.
Open **girlpower.v4p** for more information ;)

##  Known issues:

Consult girlpower.v4p for known issues

##  License:

It had a non-commercial but then the whole thing broke and doesn't work. FBX4V will be merged into mp.dx soon which means it'll be under MIT license from that moment.

Enjoy!
