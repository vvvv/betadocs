In this little beginners project I will show you how to make a cute little clock inside vvvv.

I will show how to make a clock and the clock hands, make them rotate using some simple maths, get the current time and covert some values to strings to show them on the renderer.

It might not look the best, but we handle a lot off different datatypes and nodes, and it is really an awesome project to follow and learn some off the basics off the powerfull vvvv software.
