For every one who wonders what an easy way could be to master the Arduino microprocessor board, and control it with vvvv, I introduce the Firmata firmware. 

Just upload to the Firmata sketch to your Arduino and start playing with the input pins and the output pins.

I will show you Buttons, Potentio meters, Light resistors, Piezo speakers, Servo engines and an LED,

All the electronics used are the BASIC examples of Arduino.

I am just showing a modified Firmata patch from the Girlpower folder, so there is nothing to download.
