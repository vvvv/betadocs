In this, rather long tutorial, I will be showing you how to receive Arduino messages inside vvvv, and use those to make a basic picture rotator.

We will create a capacitive sensor for Arduino, using a pencil and a piece of paper. Once that is done we will modify the Arduino code so we can use the Serial communication (RS232) inside vvvv to receive the messages and convert them to a simple interface to control a basic picture rotating slide show.

The hardware is easy, and the code is not hard so lets start!!
